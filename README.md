PoE Pulse was a program that flashes the mouse cursor in Path of Exile when you press Alt+Space so that you can find where it is. It is no longer particularly useful because the cursor was changed to be much more noticable some time in 2013.This project's presence on github is mostly for reference as to how one would go about changing another application's cursor.
 
PoE Pulse has a system tray icon that allows you to change the default hotkey combination and to close the application.

PoE Pulse stores registry information at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Aaron Opfer\PoE Pulse`.

PoE Pulse is released with a GPLv3 license.
