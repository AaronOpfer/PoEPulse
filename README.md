PoE Pulse is a program that flashes the mouse cursor in Path of Exile when you press Alt+Space so that you can find where it is.

PoE Pulse has a system tray icon that allows you to change the default hotkey combination and to close the application.

PoE Pulse stores registry information at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Aaron Opfer\PoE Pulse`.

PoE Pulse is released with a GPLv3 license.

PoE Pulse is no longer relevant for Path of Exile as the cursor was changed many months ago to be much more noticeable. This project's presence on github is mostly for reference.
